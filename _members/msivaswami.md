Muthu is a Research Associate at **MBZUAI**, working in the Computational Biology and Cancer Regulatory Genomics (**CBCRG**) Lab in Abu Dhabi under the supervision of [Dr. Aziz Khan](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/aziz-khan/). His research focuses on the integration of multi-omics data to investigate the genetic basis of disease as well as phenotype analysis.

At CBCRG, Muthu contributes to the development of scalable, reproducible bioinformatics pipelines for the analysis of whole-genome, transcriptomic, and epigenomic data.

Prior to joining **MBZUAI** Muthu was a Bioinformatics Intern at [Dubai Health Genomic Medicine Centre](https://dubaihealth.ae/), where he worked on and developed scalable pipelines for clinical exome reannotation, as part of the Genomics Department, under the guidance of [Dr. Ahmad Tayoun](https://www.mbru.ac.ae/a-z-directory/ahmad-abou-tayoun/).

Muthuâ€™s broader research interests include population genomics, variant interpretation, and the application of AI-driven approaches to enable precision medicine, particularly in historically underrepresented populations in science. As an advocate for diversity in science, he is also a big proponent of open-source science and software, as well as tools for computational biology.
