My name is Aruzhan Zhamalbek, and I am Master's student at MBZUAI, joining Professor Aziz Khan's lab. I graduated with a B.S. in Bioengineering from NYU Abu Dhabi, where I explored the intersection of bioengineering and bioinformatics. I bring over three years of wet lab experience in vaccine development, micro-device engineering, CRISPR, and stem cell research.

Building on this foundation, I am now transitioning into computational biology and genomic data analysis, with research interests in omics studies, big data, and genetic variation.
