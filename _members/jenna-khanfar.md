Jenna is a Masterâ€™s student in the Machine Learning program at MBZUAI. She earned her B.Sc. in Bioengineering from New York University Abu Dhabi (NYUAD), where her capstone project focused on developing machine learning algorithms to reconstruct fractured bone models from CT scans for tissue engineering applications.

During her undergraduate studies, she gained research experience in biomaterials, epigenetics, and biomedical device design through projects at NYU Tandon and NYUAD. At MBZUAI, she is part of the Computational Biology and Cancer Regulatory Genomics (CBCRG) Lab, with research interests in computational genomics, regenerative medicine, and the application of machine learning to biological systems.
