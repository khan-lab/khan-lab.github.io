Shreyansh is a Visiting Researcher at MBZUA in the Computational Biology and Cancer Regulatory Genomics (CBCRG) Lab and a Pre-Doctoral Research Fellow at the Mphasis AI & Applied Tech Lab, Ashoka University, India. He is also a Visiting Academic at University of Southampton.
He completed his Bachelor’s degree (Biology major, Computer Science minor) and a Postgraduate Diploma in Research (Computer Science thesis, Chemistry concentration) from Ashoka University, India.

His research sits at the interface of biology and computation, with a primary focus on Computational Oncology viewed through the lens of developmental biology. He is particularly interested in how cell fate decisions, growth dynamics, and tissue organization contribute to cancer progression. More recently, he has developed a strong interest in AI-powered virtual cell models, which offer a promising avenue for simulating complex cellular behaviors and decoding disease mechanisms at scale. Through this interdisciplinary work, he aims to advance precision medicine and contribute to innovative, data-driven approaches in biomedical science.
