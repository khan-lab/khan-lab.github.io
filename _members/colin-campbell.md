I am a Visiting Researcher from NYUAD. I am interested in chromatin regulation, stem cell biology, and transcriptional control. My work focuses on how cytoskeletal components influence gene expression and cell fate decisions. At MBZUAI, my work focusses on the role of beta actin as a regulator of super enhancers.
